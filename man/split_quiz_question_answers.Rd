\title{Split quiz questions into metadata and answer mappings}
\usage{
split_quiz_question_answers(quiz_questions)
}
\arguments{
\item{quiz_questions}{data frame returned by `/courses/{course_id}/quizzes/{quiz_id}/questions`.
The object must contain a question identifier (`id` or `question_id`) and
an `answers` column.}
}
\value{
Named list with `questions` (metadata without the `answers` column)
   and `question_answers` (flattened answer rows).
}
\description{
Canvas returns each quiz question with an `answers` list column that
contains every multiple choice option (with their own `id` and `text`).
`split_quiz_question_answers()` removes the nested column and returns a list
with `questions` (one row per question) and `question_answers` (one row per
answer, with `question_id` and `answer_id` for easy joins).
}
\examples{
questions <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2),
  question_name = c("First", "Second"),
  answers = I(list(
    data.frame(id = c(10, 11), text = c("A", "B"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
    data.frame(id = 20, text = "C", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  )),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
split_quiz_question_answers(questions)
